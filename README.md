# How they *really* voted

A site to show how votes were casted by Christchurch City Councillors.

## About

In light of a somewhat questionable site being created in order to show how councillors have voted, this site has been created to show a more balanced and less biased view into voting records. All records are sourced directly from the Christchurch City Council meeting agendas, the project is also open-source in order to show transparency into how the data is gathered. 

The reason for this being created is because,
- In the original site, motions were given names that didnt properly reflect what said motion was about.
- The original version was made as a political tool to gain votes, this version aims for complete transparency.
- Not every voting record is shown in the original version, only the ones that make the creator and their "bloc" look favourable.

There is no doubt that I disagree with the original version and it's creator, however the idea is sound and can be a genuinely useful tool wth the correct setup.

All data is directly pulled from the Council site using Python scripts, found in `/scraper`.

## Contributing

Feel free to make contributions and changes to help keep this project accurate. Feel free to message me directly for any ideas or thoughts.

## Future

Hopefully this site is no longer needed in the next few years, there is talks of an official CCC voting record tool being created internally. Similar to the Wellington City Council one.
